"Ive had a cold which started on Christmas eve but appeared to be getting better over the following week. However I now have what I think may be sinusitis - pain in the head, yellow mucus from the nose and stuffiness-squeaking from the sinuses. Will this go away on its own or should I see my GP?","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor! Yes, from what you have described, it appears that you are having Sinusitis. However, you need to be examined to diagnose it finally. So I'd recommend you to visit your GP and get yourself examined. In case the diagnosis is confirmed, you'll require a dose of Antibiotics to ward off the infection. Also, your GP will advise you certain precautions which need to be followed.

"I had cervical laminectomy surgery for spinal stenosis in Aug 2010. Since then I have a real tight neck that wants to keep dropping , neck pain , light headedness, back pain, occasional loss of balance and trouble walking and climbing steps. I recently lost my job because of these issues. My Neurologist thinks it is all coming from the neck tightness. My Neuro Surgeon disagrees and sent me to Physical Therapy and a Pain Management Doctor. They both agree with my Neurologist. The Pain Management Specialist told me that there is nothing that can be done. He told me 1 out of 10 or 1 out of every 12 with this surgery end up like me. In the past 3 months I started experiencing tremors in my right hand, right arm, shoulder, neck & head. Aggressive at times. I have tremors pretty much daily now. My Neurologist retired but wanted me to get a second opinion because I am progressing. I have not yet had a second opinion away from the same Medical Practice. I was about to when my Neuro Surgeon called and wanted me to get a Neck MRI. She referred me to another Neurosurgeon she works with to have more surgery. I saw the new Neurosurgeon. He explained he wants to take the hardware from my previous surgery out of the back of my neck and put it in the front to hold my head up. I was told it would not relieve the pain or any other symptoms I am having. I was also sent to another Neurologist in the same practice. She has no idea what is going on. Parkisons was ruled out. Both Neurosurgeons think there is something else going on and it s not coming from my neck. I can feel everything coming from my neck. I have had since May 2 neck MRI s & 4 Botox Injections, in the last 30 days an EEG, Brain MRI & CT Scan. All are normal except CT scan. It was to check healing for removing metal in my neck. I have an appointment to talk about that in a few weeks. Do you think there could actually be 2 different problems? My neck is really tight and like I said before I feel everything but my hand and arm tremors coming from my neck. I am really confused.","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",Thanks for writing to us. You have complex story with multiple issues and not pointing to a particular one problem. Tremors can happen in severe cervical spine stenosis due to weakness in extremities. Do you have significant weakness in hands? Neck Chat Doctor.  Difficult to tell you the exact answer however if neurologist ruled out other brain related disorder then you may consider doing anterior cervical surgery. Thanks.
"Hello, At the end of lacrosse practice about a week ago i recieved a nasty cross check to my deltoid. The check hit wierd, as it went under my pad. The pain came in right away, couldnt move my arm for the rest of the night.

I need to get back on the field asap before try outs are over.","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Dear List, I believe you may have suffered a muscle strain, maybe even a partial tear.

"Hello,I have a friend that just expressed a concern for her health. She said she is experiencing pain under her ribcage on the left side shooting through to her back, her vision is blurry and she is extremely fatigued and had noticed sensitivity in her lower left leg accompanied by slight swelling. She is concerned because cancer runs in her family. Any ideas what may be causing this and what we can do while attempting to find her a doctor in this area?","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should not worry much about her. As I don't think it is cancer. But better to get done some investigation s to rule out other causes. First get done ECG to rule out cardiac cause for left sided chest pain. If this is normal than get done chest x-ray to rule out pulmonary causes for chest pain. If this is also normal than no need to worry much. It is just musculoskeletal pain only. So avoid heavy weight lifting and strenuous exercise. Take good painkiller and muscle relaxant. You will be alright. No need to take stress and tension for cancer.

I have been on birth control pill for about 3months and last week when I was supposed to take placebo pills but instead I skipped them and started a new sheet. Now my period has been late by about 4days and Im starting to freak out if im pregnant or I just skipped a period. I have no spitting or bleeding whatsoever. Do I have a high chance of being pregnant?,"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, I understand your concern.  You are on contraceptive pills for last 3 months. This month also you had taken the pills without any break... only thing is instead of taking the bland pills. your straight way started with active pills of new packs.... The placebo pills are meant for getting breakthrough bleeding (which we call menses). Between two packs. But by taking new pack again you have extended the hormonal effect for one more cycle. That's why you have skipped one menstruation.  Please don't worry, if you continue with the new pack regularly, your contraceptive protection would continue. And you will get bleeding next month while you take placebo pills for 7 days.  - In case you have some doubts, you can stop taking the pills now, wait for 8 days without any pills. You would get bleeding in these days. Now, you have to throw the pack you were taking & start with a new pack on 5th day again.  Thanks."

"Hi, me and my girlfriend were foolin around and I ended up ejaculating on her chest. Some semen ran down but she doesnt think she got any in her vagina. She then took a shower and got it all off.

I have gone through your query and would like to offer my opinion.

Semen or pre-ejaculate, if deposited on the vulval region during the fertile or ovulation phase, which is two weeks prior to the onset of the next period, can cause conception. This is when protection is needed to avoid pregnancy. Hope your query has been clarified. Take care."

"I got my period last week and after my period I engaged in sexual intercourse. We did use a condom but it slipped off, so I took two of the plan B pills. One week later, I started to have vaginal bleeding . This lasted for about 3 days and stopped today. But today I ve been feeling chest and stomach pains.

I have a high pain threshold, but when it flares i can t use my arm","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, Thanks for your query. An initial X-ray of the injured part is mandatory to rule out any bony injury (fracture). If the X-ray is negative for a fracture, then the other possibility is soft tissue injury either to the ligaments, tendons etc. The initial management for your condition is as follows -- Give adequate rest to the injured part and avoid any movements that produce pain-Apply ice wrapped in a damp towel to the injured area for 15 to 20 minutes every two to three hours during the day-Compress or bandage the injured area to limit any swelling and movement that could damage it further.

"I went to a Kidney doctor recently, had been going to one for about 5 years, but they seem to keep changing on me. This new Dr. said he wanted to lower my B.P. more, and they day I as in to see him it was a bit high 146/78 but no really that much out of line. He said he would like to see it 140/70 or less. The next day it was 131/68, and hadn t taken the prescription he recommended. However did take it a couple of days later, and my feet and ankles swelled and are still swelled, the Med was Amalodapine the dose I was on was .5 and he doubled it. I called him today, and he put me back on my regular dose, but added a new B.P. med called Spironolactone .25 mg. I have been on Lorsartin and Amalodapine for several years and it has been holding my B/P under control pretty well. Why would he want to be changing it...my thinking is if it s not broken, don t fix it, and my regular health care physician had put me on it. This is a new, young Dr. and it was my understanding that they no longer want your B/P to get to low, to you don t function well?? What is your opinion on this new med. He told me not to take my over the counter Potassium. Thanks, Betty","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello, Amlodipine may cause pedal edema in some individuals. So he reduced the dose.

Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. From your history, I guess that your son has got frequent respiratory complaints, most probably due to allergy.

"I am in constant pain around my rib cage on the left side. It all started with herniated disks in my neck, for which I had a cervical diskectomy in 2000 and now a chiropractor has told me that I have a bulging thoracic disk. Do you think my rib cage pain is from my thoracic spine? Is surgery done for bulging and not herniated disks (if theres a difference)?

Is this an infection or what","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi. Thanks for the query. As there was stinky white stuff from a hole in the gum in the very back region of mouth, then it is most probably due to the hole from which wisdom tooth is about to erupt.

Treatment is mainly symptomatic which might require inhalation steroids, beta agonists, anticholinergics as MDI or rota haler as a regular treatment. There are very good medicines like steroids, alpha a Chat Doctor. To decrease the inflammation of bronchi and bronchioles, you might be given oral antihistamines with mast cell stabilizers(montelukast) and steroids (prednisolone) with nebulization and frequently steam inhalation.

I want kidney transplant for him. pls help me.. thanks,"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Dear Sarah, thanks for query. Your sentiments are fine and understandable, but you also need to know whether he will sustain this kind of major surgery. He is quite aged and major surgery at his age carries more risk, apart from he must be having other medical conditions like hypertension and diabetes which has lead to this kidney failure. Dialysis is of course a not a cure for this, but this will help him to stay alive. Please discuss this with your doctor also. Bye and take care."
"Hi,I am suffering from hair loss and thinning of hair. I am looking for a good dermatologist in Bangalore, who can help me to reduce the hair loss process and regrow my hair. I have a family history of hair loss, but I believe I can slow it down with medicines. I have been using Minoxidil 10% from past one year, I think its effectiveness has reduced with the passage of time. I would be grateful, if you can help me out. Am quite tensed, thanks","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello, I can understand your concern it would be very helpful if I could know your age and gender and see some pictures of your scalp. You may have halogen effluvium of female pattern hair lessor an Chat Doctor. Hairfall may be due to lack of nutrients like iron or proteins in body, it may also be due to deranged thyroid levels. So to rule out halogen effluvium I would advise you to get your he, serum ferritin and thyroid levels tested.it may be genetic too. Application of minoxidil and oral biotin once a day can really be helpful to you. Minoxidil is slow method, it takes time to show results, and you have to be compliant with its use, leaving it abruptly can again result in hair loss. So be patient and keep using it. Still if you don't find any results you can go for procedure like PRP (plasma rich platelet) therapy, it could help you as results seen are very good. And you can consider hair transplant too. Hope it would help. Thank you"

That will really tell the reason for your bruising. Hopefully that will turn out to be normal and you don't have to worry about that if it doesn't happen frequently. Thanks

However, every 6-12 months after having lots of sex (wife, no STD) the pain gets worse and i feel nauseous all the time.

"Hi, I have PCOD problem.I took Menogaun injection 150 mg from day 3 to 6 and again after follicle study on 13th day again 2 injections. On 16th day i had 18mm follicle in my left ovary.i took ChatDoctor on 17th day and IUI on 18th day. And was told to have intercourse on 19th and 20th day. today is my 19th day.I had intercourse yesterday. Will i have my egg still active should i have intercourse today?","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hallow dear, I have understood your concern. Usually the follicle is mature to release healthy egg at 18 mm size. In. Chat Doctor was given to you when the follicle was 18 mm size. So it was well the timed. The egg is released usually within 24 hours of Chat Doctor injection. Hence, immediately on the next day, very rightly GUI was performed. Now daily intercourse for two days after that is advised for additional coverage, in case the egg is released late. After the ovulation life of an egg is 24 hours. So any intercourse after that may not be of use from fertility angle. Continuation of ultrasonography for confirmation of ovulation might have been useful to decide how long daily or alternate days' intercourse is to be continued. However, there is no harm in continuing daily intercourse even otherwise also. I hope I have clarified your doubts. This information may be useful to you if needed (which I wish should not be required) for future cycles."

This symptom is called paresis, and is produced when the highly acid content of the stomach is returned to esophagus or, sometimes, throat and mouth.

"Hi, I am having problems with a upper tooth that I had removed 4 weeks ago. It all started when my tooth was damaged through a basic root canal treatment. I was referred to a specialist and 9 months later I was told it would have to be extracted, meanwhile I had faced a number of infections and 2 courses of antibiotics. At the time of the extraction the root was infected. After the extraction, dissolvable stitches were put in place as I was flying overseas and the sinus was exposed. Now, 4 weeks later, my dossolvable stitches are still in place and seem to be surrounded by a white gooey substance. When I touch with a Q tip the white substance moves about, attached to the stitches and is adding to some slight irritation of that area. Is this normal?

Both my husband and i were treated with the 4 pill dose of antibiotics to kill this std. i was instructed to not have sex for 10 days however on the morning of the 8th day we had sex.  Do you think there was enough time in that seven days for the treatment to have fully worked? or should i be worried about reinfection?","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, I understand your concern.  You were advised to follow abstinence for 10 days following treatment for trichomoniasis. This was to ensure complete irradiation of the Richmond from both partners systems.

You're having a short period of abstinence, there remains a possibility of reinfection. You can use a course Vaginal pessaries to avoid it.

As you mentioned of facing issue with shoulder pain, neck pain, balance issues etc. I will recommend first to take the detailed clinical assessment. Based on this we can understand as what MRI needs to be performed. But on a safer side taking and MRI of the cervical spine and brain in contrast will make some insight. The pain in the neck and shoulder - this looks more of the Neuromuscular issue. Like if there is any pinch of the nerve root in the cervical spine then there is a possibility of the radiating symptoms and pain. For which physical therapy is a choice to get solution for. Evidence of research has a good support. For the balance issue - it should be assessed in detail as this can occur due to two issues. One any vestibular related issue or any cerebellar related issue. Understanding the proper clinical examination and the MRI should help assist further by which the help can be initiated. For anything more you can surely ask me I will be happy to assist you.

"My daughter started developing intermittent swollen glands in her neck in middle school.

What should be done?","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, Thanks for your query.

Ganglion cyst is connected with a joint (shoulder in this case) and filled with joint fluid. Pain is characteristic for this lesion especially when moving the limb. I suggest you to consult general surgeon with these issues. Soft tissues' ultrasound should be done to diagnose it. Cyst or ganglion can be removed. If it's a lymph node, biopsy should be done.

"I Kusum 38 Indian -> Its being almost 2 years after marriage; due to doctor negligence i lost my left fallopian tube, the case was treated as ectopic pregnancy. Now its almost 10years I am not pregnant. IUI, polycystic, harmones level is being checked. But still no positive.  Request to help/guide me.","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi Museum, From you history I gather that all your investigations are normal. Except for removal of left fallopian tube. Your other risk factor is age of 38 yrs. Tubal pregnancy is due to some sort of damage to inside of tube, may be infection or surgery etc. Usually if one tube is damaged by infection, other one also s at risk of damage, you never get cold in one nostril !! So no matter what you do, GUI or injections Sperm & egg may not be meeting at all. Keeping history of failed treatments, History of tubal damage & most important age of 38 yrs, I would advise you to try IVF. Once you reach 40 yrs, your ovaries will not have healthy eggs enough to have pregnancy. In IVF tube is not needed & pregnancy chances are high. It is costlier than other methods but has definitely higher pregnancy chances. Hope I have clarified your overall the best Chat Doctor."

The most widely accepted theory describes meniscal cysts resulting from extrusion of synovial fluid through a peripherally extended horizontal meniscal tear, accumulating outside the joint capsule. They arise more commonly from the lateral joint margin, and occur most often in 20 to 40-year-old males. Sebaceous cysts originate from sebaceous glands in skin and contain sebum. Bakers cyst"
"Sometimes when I hear a certain noise, (its mostly the beep sound my toaster makes) I start feeling scared, paranoid or just like something bads gonna happen, sometimes the noise brings back the memory of when I had my first seizure and I feel like I do after a seizure. I have ADD, ADHD and epilepsy in case that has anything to do with it","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I think this is a new development for you. With anxiety disorders, such fear is common. Anxiety disorder patients slowly develop irritation towards noises and in due course the irritation makes them obsessive towards noises. Some specific noise irritation takes up center stage of the obsession, and they feel such noises. There is nothing to worry. This will be there for some months and slowly disappear. You will need Cognitive Therapy. Consult a psychologist. If you still need my assistance in this regard, please use this link. http"

From your question it looks that your husband has a psychotic illness, he is on separate sprinkles and risperidone 3 mg but still has auspiciousness and talks out of context. Dosage of separate is not mentioned.  From my clinical experience I can say that either the dosage of the medicine is low or maybe he is not taking it regularly. So, if you are sure of compliance, it will be very helpful to increase TH dose of risperidone to 4\u00a0mg - 6\u00a0mg in a day. Along with it, I have seen clonazepam 0.5-1 mg effective in case when patient is difficult to manage /gets very angry/unable to sleep, on as and when required basis. It is advisable to get sodium valproate levels done, to ensure that the sprinkles are providing adequate among of Chat Doctor. Please donor loose hope, it is not at all difficult to manage such cases, what is needed is dose adjustment and make sure he takes the medicine daily, and he will start behaving normally once again.

"I am a 37 year old female. This morning I started with a chest pain on the upper left side. It is a constant hurt but more intense when I move, talk till give out of breath, bending over, turning head to left or right. This has been going on for several hours now. What could it be?","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion, your upper left sided chest pain is mostly due to muscular cause but better to rule out cardiac cause first. So get done 1. ECG 2. 2d echo. If both are normal then no need to worry about cardiac cause. Muscular pain appears more in your case. So try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1.  Avoid heavyweight lifting. 2.  Avoid strenuous exercise. 3. Avoid bad postures in sleep.  Also avoid movements causing pain. 4. Start painkiller and muscle relaxant. 5. Apply warm water pad on affected site. Don't worry, you will be alright."

The anticipation of these attacks causes further anxiety. If these attacks are very distressing I would advise you to start a SSRI preferably Paroxetine (Part CR 12.5 mg) at bedtime and continue it for at least 6 months. It can be increased further with a psychiatrist advice.  You should not take Mizoram unsupervised for so long. Also get one ECG and TSH done to rule out any other physical cause of anxiety.

The area should be cleaned with an antiseptic solution and topical antibiotics applied. She may need to have it reviewed by her doctor at intervals to make sure that it is healing well.

"Areas of skin on arms, shoulders, abdomen are intensely itchy before a bump appears. The bump appears to have a tiny hole in the center. The bump is symmetrical and round. When it is healing it appears to have an indention in the skin (like a little skin is missing). It may start to dry up and appear to heal, but then the itching starts again and the whole cycle repeats. Topical steroids are less effective for itch than triple antibiotic oint. I am desperate and have even switched from goats milk soap to pine tar soap. I have allergies/ asthma . I take allergy shots, but these areas are not hives . The only secretions that come from these bumps are blood (or clear fluid). If they ever do manage to heal, my skin is left scarred.","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello, It does appear that you may have eczema, although they are not intensely itchy. I hope these have not happened after the allergy shots in which case you need to get the concentration and content of the shots (subcutaneous immunotherapy, I suppose) reviewed by your Allergist. Long-acting antihistamines are recommended as a trial in the first instance. If you wish to exclude a fungal infection, a skin scraping needs to be taken and KOH preparation under Woods lamp will reveal this. However, this is unlikely. I was not sure what you meant with the soap, but soaps are not recommended in Chat Doctor."

Better to consult a psychiatrist for proper treatment plan and in case, you need further help, you can ask us. Thanks"
"I am 36 next month and had an ectopic in feb of this year ( surgery , but tube saved). I also miscarried at 5 weeks ( just a couple of days ago). I have a ten year old daughter from previous relationship. Is my body trying to tell me that I m too old for another pregnancy. Should I try ivf ?","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello dear, I understand your concern. In my opinion the problem in your case is maintained of pregnancy but not formation of embryo. Usually IVF is suggested to those who are not able to conceive naturally. But in your case the pregnancy occurred naturally both of the times, but first one got terminated due to ectopic and 2nd one due to miscarriage. The cause for ectopic cannot be pinpointed, but the miscarriage might be due to genetic anomalies or hormonal insufficiency like thyroid abnormalities or progesterone insufficiency, diabetes etc. So I suggest you to rule out thyroid abnormalities, diabetes etc. Also give a gap of 3 months for next conception. And start taking folic acid tablet starting one month before planning the pregnancy. And as you are 36 years get screened for Down syn Chat Doctor. Nothing to worry. Untoward effects might not repeat in further pregnancy. Relax. Avoid stress. As stress also might hamper the normal hormonal balance in body leading to untoward effects. Hope this helps.

So, I suggest discussing with his doctor if your son is suffering from gastritis or HERD in order to start appropriate treatment. You are also saying that your son is a college boy. Being stressed out/anxious of exams and other college-related stuff would also affect him negatively leading to such problems. I suggest being close to him and support him, letting him know that you are proud of him whatever results he gets in the exams. If you cannot be close to him, you can ask to get helped by his friends or by medical team (psychotherapy). At the end, I also suggest going to his college, ask his teachers and classmates about his behavior to understand more his current situation. I also suggest getting blood/urine sample for Chat Doctor."
"Sir, Iam using encorate chrona for my daughter since 5months as prescribed by nuerologist she is putting on weight is ti the side effect of the medicine this has been prescribed for 2 years for absent seizures she is 8 yrs old now?------ YYYY@YYYY","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, Thank you for posting your query. I have noted your daughters symptoms. She has absence seizures, which seem to be well controlled with sodium valproate. However, she is also putting on weight. Most probably, weight gain in your daughter is related to the use of sodium valproate. We should not stop valproate, as her seizures may worsen. Instead, we can control her diet and make her play outdoor games. These measures would keep her weight in check. I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow-up queries or if you require any additional information. Wishing you good health, Chat Doctor. Ly/"

does wearing diaper have any effect on baby penis growth my baby is 9 months old he wears diaper for whole day and at night for 5 to 6 hours i keep him without diaper when he is sleeping in the morning i pack him again does it have any effect on baby penis growth i m really conserned and would be very thankful to you for answering me,"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",No it does not affect the growth of penis.  However the diaper should be of proper size so that your baby feels it comfortable.  The only thing you have to worry about is rashes.  The baby might get rashes and secondary infection due to constant moistness and the ammonia present in babies urine. There has not been any proper mass research on this issue and in my career i haven't seen anything like that or guard about that.  As far as theory is concern you don't have to worry about it.  Just enjoy the childhood and motherhood.
hi. I went to see a doctor about 4 days ago because I was on amoxicillin treatment due to tonsil infections and after I forgot to finish my dosage I went in for another one because the symptoms and signs were starting to show again. the doctor gave me an injection on my buttocks and now I feel numb around the hips and when I try to press the area I was injected I feel like some stringy thing around the numb area. what can be the cause of this numbness?,"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. As per your complaint it seems that you have got a nerve injury with the pricking needle that is used in the injection and due to nerve injury there is numbness in the injection site along with the adjoining area supplied by the nerve leading to numbness. The stringy substance that you are feeling can be due to infection leading to pus formation. Mostly nerve injuries caused by needle prick are transient and the sensation almost completely recovers. As of now you can take vitamin B complex daily as it helps in nerve regeneration and healing. Do warm compresses over the numb area. If there is any stringy discharge you should consult a Physician and get evaluated so that he can give you oral and topical antibiotics for resolution of infection. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.

I appreciate your generosity and gesture towards your friend. You will not be considered as an eligible donor unless you stop smoking for at least 8 weeks prior to donating the kidney. This is because there are many known health risks from smoking1. It can cause potentially life-threatening respiratory complications during or immediately after anesthesia. 2. It may also increase the risk of developing blood clots in the leg veins which can break loose, travel to the lungs and potentially cause death.  3. Furthermore, it causes increased mucus production and a decreased ability to clear the lungs which can lead to pneumonia. 4. Furthermore, it causes decreased wound healing.  To be eligible you must quit smoking first and after 8 weeks you can donate the kidney to your friend after getting the pre-operative medical fitness. Since smoking is associate with a number of diseases of the heart and the lungs and various cancers so, it's better to quit smoking ASAP. Hope I could answer your query."

"Hello!I have what I believe is an impacted wisdom tooth. The actual tooth part doesnt start until almost my gumline. The other day, I bit too hard into the gum that is still on the impacted wisdom tooth and created a sore lump. Now I cannot chew on the left side of my mouth or close my mouth all the way.","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","With your query, as you mentioned that you have impacted tooth that means the tooth hasn't reached to its causal level and still covered by gum that is technically called as periodontal flap. Coming to your swelling I mean the lump could be a periodontal abscess which may be due to forceful food impaction in to gingival called as pseudo pocket. Treatment for this are by two means initially it has to get irrigated by an antiseptic solution then either you should go for a procedure called operculectomy which means removal of gingival or gum that is present over the tooth. This decision will be made by examining the tooth eruption status by radiograph and your age. In some instances if they decide tooth development is complete and chances of recurrence is more than you may have to undergo extraction for the impacted tooth.  I would suggest you to go and visit oral surgeon for time being you can start using antibiotics along with painkillers and visit dentist as early as possible for complete treatment. It is unethical to prescribe antibiotics without knowing your Chat Doctor. Hope this is informative"

"hi.. i ve been taking pills since july 2012, i was using azul, but last month, february , i changed my pill to althea, and i took the first tablet even if i was done with my menstruation . it was stated on the instructions that it s ok to start the pill at any day as long as you follow the days indicated on the pill pack. but on the first week that i was taking the pill i was also taking antibiotics/antibacterial named amoxicillin . and i had made out with my boyfriend on the 5th day that i was taking pills. i finished my 21st tablet last march 2 and it s already march 6 today and i still don t have my period. the last day of my period was jan. 30.. i did some research and it says that antibiotics don t interfere with the pill except the one named rifampin. so i m confused, am i pregnant? pls help me. -AAAAAAA. stressed out-","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello, Thanks for posting, Well I do not think you are pregnant if you have been taking the pills as indicated even though it will be wise to conduct a pregnancy test in about a weeks time just to be sure that pregnancy is not the cause of your amenorrhea. Pills are hormone based and can alter the concentrations of your natural hormones there by leading to menstrual irregularities. Since you changed abruptly your initial birth control and introduced a new one, it is possible that it is the change that lead to this. Menstrual irregularities e.g., spotting, breakthrough bleeding or amenorrhea can occur during its use. Most of these side effects are mild and usually disappear after a few months of contraceptive use. So I suggest you worry less than stress on its own can lead to menstrual irregularity. Hope this helps"
Hello I just noticed I have a bump in my pubic area. It s about the size of a kidney bean. I haven t shaved lately. My boyfriend and I just started having sex again after months of no sex because we had a miscarriage and D&C. Do you know what this might be?,"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello, Welcome to ChatDoctorThanks for posting your query in Chat Doctor. Bumps in pubic area are very common because of increased hair present in this region. It might be just a folliculitis that is infection of hair follicle. It may also be an enlarged lymph node or blocked sebaceous gland present enormously in this area. I would advise you to keep the area clean and give hot fomentation to the affected area as frequently as possible. Pain and swelling will come down. If it doesn't get relieved, you need to see your treating doctor for physical examination. Hope you are happy with the answer. Thank you."
"I am having  alot of jaw pain and throbbing with headache 24/7 after having 2 crowns worked on last week. any ideas are welcome, I am seeing my dentist tomorrow, but would like to have appropriate feedback / questions for him. I dont think this should hurt so much.","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",Hi. Can understand your concern. As per your complaint you have got two crowns placed and pain after this can be due to either of the following reasons. One reason can be in case if the crowns were placed without root canal treatment of tooth (it is a treatment in which the nerves and blood vessels present in the tooth are cut off either to relieve pain due to infection or as an intentional procedure to avoid complications like pain and sensitivity after crown placement) the preparation of the tooth for seating the crown if done in excess can lead to opening of nerves and when the crown is placed over opened nerves it can cause inflammation of nerve and hence severe pain. In case if the crowns are placed after root canal treatment for an infected tooth pain can be due to persistent infection leading to pus formation and pressure which is not subsided or there is some vital nerve tissue left out in any missed root canal can cause severe pain on crown placement. I would suggest you to consult an ENDODONTIST and get evaluated clinically as well as by getting x-ray done to rule out the cause of pain. In case if root canal is not done and pain is due to irritated nerves the crown needs to be removed followed by Root canal treatment and medicines and once pain is completely subsided crown can be placed again. In case of root canal treated tooth also re treatment will have to be done. You can take painkiller like Eugenic plus or Retool DT (one tablet dissolved in half a glass of water) to provide relief. Hope your query is solved. If you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.

"Hello, I m pretty sure I inhaled a piece of corn last night..I did it about a month ago too and was surprised it went down so easily without much couphing..I put my head down to my feet and managed to cough it out. I don t know what to do..I do have some mucus and some coughing fits but I m thinking maybe it s in my head? But I also feel like something is in my lungs that needs to be coughed up...what to do?","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","The airways have a strong defense mechanism, thus the corn may have come out and not noticed by you. Even if it hasn`t come out, it will be dealt by body defenses and may not cause any problem. However, it can get lodged in the bronchial tree(airways) depending on it's size. It may lead to collapse of a portion of lung depending on the site of impaction and may lead to infection. If you are having symptoms, a chest X-ray or CT Scan should be done to confirm the diagnosis and to identify the site of impaction. Infection will have to be treated with antibiotics. Subsequently, it can be removed by performing a bronchoscopy."

"I have been having dizzy spells and issues with my balance for about 6 months. Sometimes the balance gets quite bad, I have never fallen but it is uncomfortable and has caused me much anxiety. I had migraines daily for 40 days, they have since stopped this was in the middle of the spells (so 3 months in). I have lower blood pressure, and have always had this. I had a full cardiac workup a year and a half ago (I was having dizzy spells but not the balance problems). When this started I felt like a wave of dizzy came up from my neck and was centralized in my left quadrant frontal of my head. I saw a neurologist at this point referred to by my GP and he couldn t find anything wrong and thought it was just unexplained sensations. My GP thought maybe seizures. After having the bout of recurring migraines I did have an MRI whicChatDoctore back normal. I am at a loss as I am still having these issues. My GP put me on Zoloft as it created anxiety but also perhaps is caused by anxiety. I don t feel this is anxiety. I also have sensations in my left calf which are either heightened or dulled (numb) in the inner medial portion and sometimes a buzzing sensation in my groin and foot. I am worried that there is something neurologically wrong with me that the MRI missed.","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, Diagnosing balance issues and dizzy spells is difficult. One important thing to rule out is cardiac reasons. Another important aspect is central nervous system reasons. It is great that you already tested for both that and the results came back normal.  From your description. I think this could be a case of polyneuropathy. The peripheral nerves sending feedback about balance are the first to be affected with chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, or it B12 deficiencies.  If I were your treating physician after detailed history and physical examination I would ask for blood tests including it. B12 levels, HbA1C, fasting glucose.  I would refer you to do a caloric ear test also, which provide an idea of the function of the balance center in the ear. I would also run a Doppler test for your carotids (Arteries in the neck the supply the brain). Based on results a therapeutic plan could be constructed.  Hope I have answered your query.

It happens with minimal sexual stimulation and before the person wishes.  Most cases of premature ejaculation do not have a clear cause. With sexual experience and age, men often learn to delay orgasm. Premature ejaculation may occur with a new partner.  It may happen only in certain sexual situations or if it has been a long time since the last ejaculation. Psychological factors such as anxiety, guilt, or depression can also cause it.  In some cases, it may be related to a medical cause such as hormonal problems, injury, or a side effect of certain medicines. In many cases premature ejaculation gets better on its own over time.  Treatment may not be needed. Practicing relaxation techniques or using distraction methods may help you delay ejaculation.

I used to be able to eat cherries before.","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor The swelling can be related to the popsicle or the cherry. Allergic reactions can be delayed by minutes or hours. In some cases even longer. In terms of the popsicle, it could be any of the ingredients within it that could cause a reaction. An oral anti histamine such as Ben Chat Doctor.  Other examples of anti histamines are carnitine, Allegra, Zyrtec, Arius. I hope this helps"

I have had several issues with bladder; kidney and uti infections for the past two years. Consistantly. A lot due to a traumatic event; raped both vaginal and rectal.

However; my main concern is,"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Get an ultrasound of whole abdomen, specially kidneys ureter and bladder, uterus and ovaries and pelvis. That would settle the issue of pregnancy too. If there is no pregnancy then a CT scan of lower abdomen can also be done to see if there is an infected collection around the bladder or in pelvis. Ultrasound and CT would also show the presence of endometriosis. Get a urine culture too. All these will guide the future treatment."
hi dr seminal fluid analysis test vol,"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello Your semen analysis findings may indicate semen infection with borderline decreased sperm motility. Infection is indicated due to presence of few pus cells in semen. Normally semen shouldn't contain any pus cells. Few RBC in semen may be due to infection.

Motility is slightly low. Normally it should be at least 55 %. Your findings suggest over all 45% motility, so it is low. Sperm count is normal. It should be at least 20 millions/ml.

"Hi I recently had lower back pain which lasted for more than a month! On taking the Xray, it showed Sacralization of L5 and mild lumbar scoliosis convex to the left with a+1 vertebral rotation at apex of the curve.Is it a very serious problem and what is the remedy for this problem.","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Sacralization of lower lumbar vertebrae like L5 means gradual fusion of the lower lumbar vertebrae as in case of the sacrum where the vertebrae are already fused. Otherwise, there is some degree of movement between the lumbar vertebrae. As a result of such fusion scoliosis or a lateral curvature of the spine may occur and the nerves exiting from the two sides of the lumbar vertebrae get compressed resulting in pain. Since it is age dependent degenerative lesion, not much can be done and there is definitely some cause of concern. Please be in the follow-up of an orthopedic. Traction and physical therapy with ultrasonotherapy and hot compress should give you relief. Surgery is required in extreme cases, but you need not panic as of now."

Stop the dam stuff. Keto amino acids have not been proven to be of any benefit at all, but still widely prescribed in India (no where else in the world can people be fooled like here!!). At the very least it should not cause any harm. However, if the Creatinine has jumped up so quickly, something is wrong here, and it might/ might not be the new medicines that you started. Many medicines can cause a kind of inflammation in kidneys called Interstitial Nephritis which can cause sudden deterioration in kidney function (especially in those with suboptimal kidney function). The cause of deterioration might be something totally different - hence very important to get back to your)or another) nephrologist and get yourself checked out. Bur stops the new medications straight away. Best wishes"
"Hi, my friend and i are currentlt travelling the world. She has ITP.  She had a splenectomy a few years ago but her spleen actually grew back! She had a relapse and her platelet count dropped to 9k last year. A month or so ago she got salmonella and they dropped again to 40k. She recovered and they went up over 150k. Recently she had another drop and they went down to 53k, then a week later 29k. She just had another blood test (these were all in the last 3 weeks, one a week) and it is 530k. No-one could explain how it could of risen so much with no medication? She has been eating slightly better the last week or so and been doing gentle exercise but could this affect it? everyone is baffled. We are in New Zealand and she wants to do a skydive. Is this recommended because we are worried that they could reduce quickly like they have risen?she had 2 blood tests to make sure the 530 was correct nd it went to 505 after 1 hour which is normal they say?and shows they are correct? what could the reason be and then maybe she can do something to try and keep them up??can she??she has also had mild nose bleeds while the count is high and this is normall sign of low count??","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, Thanks for asking. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Bone marrow biopsy will confirm the increased platelet count.2. Yes, such recovery is rare and indicates good marrow capability.3. Nose bleeds could be due to Chat Doctor.  Bleeding is usually not seen with normal platelet count. 4. During periods of sepsis platelet counts are known to fall. However, they do not fall on their own. Previously it was autoimmune disease or sepsis. Now, not to worry, she can skydive. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again."

"Trying to find the term a doctor used for my sister that I think was some type of encephanalopathy - that may be the cause of her sudden symptoms of confusion, becoming extremely lothargic and incontinence he talked about swelling in the brain that affected these three area-","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, thanks for providing the brief history of your sister. For encephalopathy you are already under the physician and a neurologist will play an important role. Looking into the MRI scan may reveal the areas involved, and the medical treatment will be initiated based on the symptoms. Rest you need to discuss with your physician or neurologist that physical therapy is an option to try for reducing the lethargic symptoms, as by doing exercise the metabolism improves and helps boost the medical treatment to get positive outcome as well. Taking to confusion it is symptomatic and will subside. For incontinence issue the brain has to start regenerating the impulses back as to which the issues will come down. Bladder training can be done under a guided physical therapist. I have seen such cases and all responded well by coordinating the medical prescription and physical therapy.

"I am 65 yrs. old female.  For about 20 yrs. Ive known Ive had a mitral valve prolapse, with just a flutter once in a while.  Id cough and it would go away.  About 3 yrs. ago I went through breast cancer, mastectomy and a tram reconstruction, nothing in my lymph nodes, so I had no further treatment needed, thankfully.  About  1 1/2 yrs. ago my doctor at my regular check up said she heard more gushing in my chest and advised me to get an echo.  I didnt really feel anything and put it  off until I needed to have more reconstuction surgery last Dec.and my plastic surgeon said the same thing, so I had it done.  My cardiologist said it was moderate to severe stenosis of the aeortic valve, and another new cardiologist gave me a card that I have a bicuspid aeortic valve. He did another echo and confirmed the first report.  It was a little hard to see, but he thought I had this from birth, but it looked like I only had 2 cusps instead of 3 and now have some calcium buildup there was why it had gotten more prounounced.  I had to have some more breast reconstruction done in December, but had it done under local.  I still need another procedure of some fat transfer done in the next months to help fill in a small sunken area above the breast.  Anyway my last cardiologist appt. in June said to wait for 6 months and have another echo, unless I have any bad symptoms before.  When I think about it it seems I have more fluttering.  Stress seems to upset it a little.  I really feel good, no pain, maybe a little shortness of breath when I climb stairways, but besides a little pounding every now and then I wouldnt know it. BP is low. But because I know it, and it was a big shock as I feel like Im falling apart and I do worry about it.  I sometimes maybe feel a little rushing in my head but thats pretty mild.  Im pretty healthy or thought I always was til now.  Im 58 weigh 148 # have some joint issues with my hips, knees and recently my shoulders, and Im more comfortable on a bike than walking because of this.  Seems to be easier on my joints.  I went to Curves for 9 years and both in our area closed in the last 6 mos., so i try to do some form of exercise at home.  Thought I could wait til I could have a non invasive approach to the valve, I just find it really hard to think of having my chest split, especially now since Ive had all my reconstruction and am in fair order there. My cardiolgist doesnt recommend the non invasive approach. And I hear the valves dont last that long and dont want to think of more surgeries down the road.  I take one drug arimidex for the breast cancer for another 2 years.  Im ready to get rid of it, as I think it has precipitated some of my joint problems.  So far my dexi scans are o.k   What are my options and warnings.","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",You are having aortic stenosis. First you need to regularize your heart check up and regular echo to know the heart functions. If cardiologist recommend you the surgery then you should undergo it. Best option available is valve replacement. Metallic valve have good life and bioprosthetic ones have short life span. However after metallic valve replacement will need blood thinners post operative. But in short if you surgery you should undergo it because without surgery prognosis is bad and survival is short
I have swelling on the upper part of my left knee. I was in ER for two days and could not move my left side much as I was given IV continuously for 48 hours. There was severe pain all around left side of the body. Now it s concentrated right above the left knee.,"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",Dear patient Why you are in ER for 2 days? Have you injured your knee and swelling was after injury?  I want to know because u did not mention this in your history. If swelling was after injury then X-ray of left knee anteroposterior and lateral views should be done to rule out fracture Since pain is not relieved in 2 days. If X-ray is normal further investigation needed is MRI of left knee to rule out soft tissue injury should be done. Visit to knee surgeon is recommended.
"Hello, I have had a recent CT scan with the radiologist statement as idiopathic Fahr s or Hypoparathyroidism. I have an appointment with a neurologist on the 1st. I have been diagnosed with ADHD and Anxiety disorder. I have had a neuro psych baseline prior to the thought of Fahr s since I thought I had early onset Alzhiemer s because of my poor memory, the psychologist said NO to that. I was found to be in menopause, 49 years old and had 0 estrogen. After that was taken care of I felt much better. However, I still feel bad and have a myriad of symptoms but would like to know of other symptoms besides the common ones that I ve read about. I quite frustrated! I was also diagnosed a year ago with a rare genetic skin disease which has not come up since and my dermatologist thought the biopsy was wrong and I might have a autoimmune disease like Lupus. SO, my question is a statement as well, I would like to know if their are more detailed daily symptoms. For example, is there a sharp nail like pain being hammered into you ankles. Or, how does the walking interference feel, is it because of a deep knee pain? Much more facts about the main symptoms and how things might feel. I appreciate any assistance.","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","In my opinion First if pain in ankle is in a specific spot in the back of your ankle + pain in the back of your knee then its just mechanical pain that can be fixed by wearing a foot arch and slightly leaning forwards while walking, second if pain is in a wide area then it could be from lumber disc lesion)From the way you wrote your question your mind and thinking are clear , you should take female hormones and check your thyroid levels, magnesium hormone imbalance can cause your foggy memory Good Luck"
"hello,im a 16 year old girl, my height being 5 4 and my weight being 98. I just wanted to know why does the whole of my body always shake when i have an argument.

I think your current situation arises out of you obsessive thoughts. You obsess with that tiredness and when such an excitement comes, body automatically completes your wish. Just ignore the problem and there goes the problem. The second incident you are talking about could just be due to tiredness after you cruel wellness/ dieting program.

"Hi, my mother is suffering from severe stomach ache which started three months ago, she is not able to eat any solid stuff, her condition is deteriorating day by day, after several tests doctors have  diagnosed her with Stage 3 Colon Cancer though her Biopsy report is pending, doctor has asked me to go for PET Scan as well to get things more clear, I request you to please suggest me if surgery is possible in her case or chemotherapy is the only option left, or if both are required.I have uploaded the CT scan, colonoscopy report, blood reports for your reference.please suggest.","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Stage 3 means that tumor infiltrated colon wall and surrounding lymph nodes - it means that surgical procedure is possible, but it can only remove microscopically cancer and involved colon. It can also remove lymph nodes, but it is not possible to be sure that cancer isn't spread already. So if ct and PE done show any metastases then surgery should be definitely done. Chemo can be started after surgery. Buzt if there is evidence of cancer outside colon then the behemoth should be done first Hope I have answered your query. Wish you good health. Regards"
my six year old has had a fever of 104.5 for 24 hours and doesn t have any other symptom we have been giving him Tylenol and ibuprofen and the lowest his fever got was 102.0 should I be concerned? what other things should I look for? after four hours of receiving the Tylenol or advil his fever goes back up from 102.0 to 104.0 so waiting the other four hours with his temp being at 104.0 scares me because I can only give it to him every 8 hours.,"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I share your concern. Fever in a sis year old in the absence of other symptoms could be considered as viral fever. You can give Tylenol every 4 hours at 10-15 mg/kg dose. And also give tepid sponging. I would do some tests like CBC and Urine RE to find the focus of infection after a thorough examination of the systems. You look for symptoms like running nose, cough, pain on passing urine. I would in my clinical practice try an empirical trial of antibiotics after careful evaluation. You can consult your doctor for further evaluation of your child. Hope I have allayed your fears.

"I am 18 years old and I was recently I have mumps. Last Wednesday I felt a tiny bit of swelling (then thought a pulled muscle) behind my right jaw. The next day I woke up and my face had clearly swollen. I booked an appointment at my University health centre where a nurse saw me, said it is very likely that I have mumps and that I need to wait 5 days from the swelling before I can leave my university dorm as I am infectious. 5 days later, after 4 days of intense pain on my face and jaw, not being able to chew anything and having no energy, I was feeling better and went out yesterday into the world. Today is 7 days since the original swelling began, I wake up and have the same feeling I did when the right side began to swell on the left side of my jaw. Its only swollen a little but it hurts when I chew more so than the right side and is painful like the right side was.Does this mean I still have mumps and have to stay in isolation for another 5 days? Will the left side get just as swollen as the right side did because I dont think I can bare the pain.Thank you","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi. Can understand your concern. As per your complaint Mumps also known as \""Epidemic Parotitis\"" is a VIRAL infection, and it can affect either one side or both sides Parotid glands which are major salivary glands leading to the above explained symptoms. It is very much clear from your explanation that you have mumps. The symptoms subside within 7 to 10 days after the symptoms appear. There is no exact treatment for mumps and only symptomatic relief can be provided. For pain, you can take Acetaminophen or Tylenol for relief. Doing cold compresses can be relieving. Take plenty of fluids which can include water, fruit juices, soups etc. Take a soft and nutritious diet. Take sufficient rest. In case if the symptoms persist for more than 10 days without any relief you should consult a physician. Although after occurrence of mumps once the person becomes immune for lifetime and relapse can be with very mild symptoms. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor."

Please consult qualified Urologist for evaluation and get the test done under his guidance to confirm the diagnosis. Further treatment will depend on upon the result of the test and final diagnosis.

"Hi, I once had a hemoglobin number of 5.6 after surgery and they gave me 10 units of blood and the number went up to about 8.5. Then they released me from the hospital.

Did they release me from the hospital too soon?","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Your Hemoglobin levels seem to be low but that can have a number of causes. From the history that you have given, it is not quite clear if your hemoglobin levels were decreased prior to surgery or after surgery. Also, only low hemoglobin levels by themselves are not always the criteria for inpatient therapy and a hemoglobin of 8.5 is quite compatible with discharge. But then again, we are not quite conversant with what condition you have been suffering from and what surgery was done. So it will be naive to comment whether you were discharged too soon."

I have a tooth that has created an absess on my gums due to a probable infection or tooth decay. What is the best solution for this problem. Would it be better to remove the tooth? I havent been to the dentist in years due to an episode when I was three years old. Im scared to go see a dentist.,"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The abscess can be because of a tooth or gum infection. If it is a tooth infection, the best way of treating it would be by root canal treatment if and only if the tooth has sufficient structure in it and has sufficient bone support. If it is secondary to gum infection, then take a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin 500\u00a0mg and metronidazole 400\u00a0mg TID for 5 days (if you are not allergic). And get your teeth cleaned once with Chat Doctor. I hope my answer will help you, take care."

"My grandaughter had a water infection when she was 5months old she has been on antibiotics since she is 8months now. The doctors ave said she cud be on them until the age of 4, she has also had 2 scans on her kidneys but have both been ok. Why is she on antibiotics for so long","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello, It is challenging to come to diagnosis with a limited history provided in the query. However, the use of long term antibiotic therapy is called for patients who suffer with immunodeficiency. The antibiotics prevent the risk of acquiring recurrent severe infections in such patients. As you have mentioned your grand child is five months old; it is likely that she is suffering from some form of rare congenital immunodeficiency. In this condition the normal infection-fighting system of the body does not function fully, making the person prone to severe infections. Apart from antibiotics other forms of treatment available for such patients includes antibody infusion, and stem cell transplantation. In addition, kidneys are usually normal as the immune cells are usually a component of blood.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
"Hello, my boyfriend has a tooth infection, he is taking antibiotics, but his next dentist appointment is not until Monday. The swellings that he had earlier from the tooth only got worse, not his entire cheek is extremely swollen. Is there anything that we can do to calm the swelling down?","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The swelling over the cheek is because of the abscess or collection of pus secondary to teeth or gum infection. Consult an oral physician and get it evaluated. If I am your treating doctor, I would have suggested you to take radiographs like RVG or IOP AR to rule out gum and teeth infection. If it is a gum or teeth infection I would have prescribed a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin and metronidazole for 5 days (if you are not allergic). Then I would have suggested going for scaling and root planing for gum infection. Root canal treatment or extraction if it is a tooth infection. It takes two days for the swelling to come down following administration of the antibiotics. I hope my answer will help you, take care."

"Hello Sir, My cousin was diagnosed with brain TB some 2 months back.She was admitted in Alleppey Medical hospital and her condition worsened over the period of time. TB tests were conducted with no positive result. Thereafter, she was moved to Chitra Medical Hospital, Trivandrum and her samples were sent to NIMHANS for further study. Meanwhile, this period my cousin was losing her vision. A brain surgery was carried out and it was found that the vein supporting the eye sight was blocked and it was infected. The doctors are saying that she will lose her eyesight in a few months or so because of the infection.

The eyes are vital organs, and it is important to treat any condition threatening eyesight immediately. TB is a condition that can present with unique symptoms and involvement of the vein supplying the eyes is rare. Since a brain surgery was carried out, it is possible that the doctors took measures to safeguard her eyesight, but little could be done as there was a lot of infection. When there is significant infection, certain decisions have to be taken by the operating surgeon to protect the life of the patient and avoid further complications. To confirm TB or not you can send slides to research hospitals elsewhere in the country but the hospitals she has shown are well known for brain disease treatments. Particularly for her eyesight, it will help if you can request the eye surgeon to have a panel discussion with her neurologist."

"My name is Humphrey iam a Nigerian,my son has breathing problem at birth, congenital ptosis of the eye due to cranial nerve damage or occulomotor and other developmental delays like speech impairment for instance he is six but still could not yet talk clearly. Doctors treating him in Nigeria are of divided opinions whether to do surgery of the eye or not this is because of the associated heart problem he has. Iam afraid because i read online that if left untreated it could result to astigimatism. Pls advice","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, The need for surgery depends on the degree of ptosis. In significant ptosis, it is better to correct, as, apart from cosmetic issue, it may cause abnormal head posture, astigmatism as you said, and amblyopia (here brain starts to ignore signal from that eye) from sensory deprivation. Regarding safety of surgery in heart disease, it will not be a problem unless the child have inadequate oxygen saturation or cardiac failure. Your doctor will consider all these things and get a pediatric / cardiology opinion before the procedure-so need not worry about that. Hope I have answered your question.

"Hi,I have a dent at the top left of my forehead where my hair line is!it was caused by someone throwing a bottle which left me with 7 stitches! This happened a few years ago but at the time the hospital never even gave me an x-Ray and just stitched me up.... This happened a few years ago, should I be worried?","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi there, Sorry to hear about the bottle and the dent! The dent at this point could be due to either a defect in the skull (would have been there for years, since the injury). Or more likely due to loss of muscle and tendon tissue in that region (could be a slow progressive process)The best way to figure t out is to get some x-rays. If it is a soft tissue (tendon and muscle), then you need to go to a cosmetic surgeon who can see if anything can be done. I hope this helps! Vinay"
just had a dentist appointment about a week ago. I have braces and they broke my wire! So the back brackets dont have a wire on the bottom. Now the place I go to is Western Dental and its also a Orthodontist place. They said they couldnt fix it until my next appointment which is on December 11. What should I do? Is this bad?,"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello, thank you for consulting with us for your problem.

"Hi Doctor,I am suffering from Urticaria since last Dec. Food allergic test conducted in your clinic on 24th Feb and in Marry Queens hospital on 30th March shows no allergic to any food except a doubtful reaction on white egg and mutton. How ever I was under full control of these items. Still the itching and hives appears always and even lead to angio edema some times with swelling of lips and difficulty in brething.

Can you please advise whether I need to undergo one more food allergy test or any other remedies.Your advice is most appreciated.ThanksSalim Shah, Trivandrum46Y, 170cm, 80Kg","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, Thank you for your query. I can understand your concerns. You are having Urticaria and angioedema. Causative allergens can be food as well as non-food protein. You can undergo serum IGE level & absolute eosinophil count. You can take H\u2081 antihistamines non-sedating agents such as loratadine, loratadine, and fexofenadine, or low-sedating agents such as cetirizine or levocetirizine. The addition of an H\u2082 antagonist such as sanitizing in conventional dosages may add benefit. A CysLT1 receptor antagonist such as montelukast, 10 mg/day also can be added. You have to continue for a longer period, as it may be seasonal. A short course of oral steroid (e.g. Deflazacort 6 mg daily orally for 7-10 days) helps in urticaria with eosinophil prominence, idiopathic angioedema with or without urticaria, or chronic urticaria that responds poorly to conventional treatment."

"I am 16 year old girl. Doctors have examined me done LFT with two readings of alkaline phosphate as 98 & 130. done EUS, US & MRI. findings are multiple calculi in my gallbladder. largest one measuring 1.4*1.4 cm. what precautions can i take and what procedure can be carried out further. as such doctors have recommened another LFT and then if the alkaline phosphate level is increased then ERCP is the next step. i would like to know what according to you can be done further?","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello there!  Thank you for asking. If gallbladder has stones the things we need to worry about is if it involves nearby bile duct and dilates the common bile duct and adds to the yellowish discoloration of the skin(jaundice). Also, the pancreatic profiles Serum amylase lipases amylase to lipase ratios. Alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels hike means that the common Bile Duct CBD is involved. And yes in that case ERCP (Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) is the next step as it would be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Then you will be prepared for simple laparoscopic cholecystectomy/ removal of gall bladder through minimal invasive procedures Providing the anesthesiologists and general surgeons give a green signal after ruling out all the contraindications for it. As you are 16 years old only. This young age with rest of it without gall bladder might advise a conservative approach. But what your doctors decide for you will be best for you and I am sure you are in safer hands. Hope I was of some help. Take care regards Chat Doctor."

Then my arms went tingling, next my hands clamped shut and continued constricting. The rapid response team came in. My face went numb, i became incoherent and sweating perfusely.

I read your question and understand your concern. I would like to know the name of the Chat Doctor.  In my opinion the symptoms you describe may be related to a possible Transient ischemic attack, which is caused by a low blood flow to the brain or a seizure, a type of Epilepsy. I don't think the injection has been the cause. Because a Transient ischemic attack can be preceded by hypertension. I would recommend a brain MRI, a cardiologist consult to find out the causes in case of a possible transient ischemic attack. An EEG would be very helpful in case of a seizure suspicion.

"i am 15 years old and i weigh 220 pounds, about two years previous i would randomly feel really dizzy and my vision would blur around the edges. Id get really weak and all shaky to the point where i couldn t hold myself up and i would have to sit down. It happened a couple of times but stopped and it hasnt happened to me since then until now. I m kind of scared because this time was worse than all the rest. I don t know what to do.","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, There can be many causes of dizziness and weakness. We need to have a detailed history and examination of it.  One of the most common causes is diseases associated with ear like labyrinthine (infection of the ear), vestibular neuritis (inflammation of the nerves), or BPPV (benign positional vertigo).  It can also be related to diseases of the brain (infection or swelling) or heart disorders (arrhythmia-rhythm disturbances) or cervical spondylosis (neck posture-related issues). Besides this, there are simpler causes like anemia (low hemoglobin), hypoglycemia (low sugar) stress, anxiety, or lack of proper sleep.  Sometimes hormonal disorders(especially thyroid-related problems) or vitamin deficiencies can also be responsible. Hence, I feel, first, focus on lifestyle modifications.  Have a well-balanced diet with lots of fruits and vegetables and less tea and coffee. Maintain proper posture while working and sleeping, take good sleep for 7-8 hours.  Try to find time to go for a walk or exercise and try to reduce weight. If still the symptoms persist then do go for some investigations like-complete blood count, sugar levels, electrolytes, TSH, ECG, X-ray cervical spine and MRI brain. If possible do get your vitamin and vitamin b12 levels checked. This will help us to make a proper diagnosis. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care"

Hi I have had a toothache for several days. Today being the worse. This makes the 2nd time this tooth has hurt. Last time I made 3 trips to the emergency room.

"HI, I have sharp pain on my left ovary . It is not that I have pain all day... just at a few ocassions I have this pains. For example if I sneeze I have this sharp pain. I am also experiencing very itchy anus . My doctor gave me a cream, which stops the itchinnes, but the next day is the same thing. I don t know if this could be related. Thanks","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello! Thank you for the query. The pain caused by ovary and itching in the anus are rather unrelated. However, close to the ovary there is a large intestine, and maybe this is what causes the pain. Anus itching can appear with hemorrhoids, rectal fissure or pin worms. Lower left abdominal pain can be caused by urinary tract infection (usually frequent urinating and pain while urinating appears), diverticulitis. As hemorrhoids and diverticulitis ca both appear because of constipation, it should be considered (if you have had constipation). Fresh blood in stool (on the surface of it) is characteristic for hemorrhoids. Pinworms usually give itching in the morning. I suggest you to visit your doctor and rule out mentioned conditions. Abdominal ultrasound, blood work, rectal examination should be performed. If pin worms seems probable, adhesive tape should collect larva and should be checked with microscope. Hope this will help. Regards."

In my opinion, we should definitely rule out arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) in your case because streptococcal infection can affect your conduction system of heart. So consult cardiologist and get done ECG, 2d echo and Holder monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ECG). If all these are normal then no need to worry about arrhythmia or other heart diseases.

LeAndra","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello dear, I understand your concern. In my opinion as you got the periods there is no chance of pregnancy. The first sign of pregnancy is missed period. Once you get the periods the pregnancy is ruled out. Usually urine pregnancy test is done a week after missed period for accurate results. So as you got the period the test is not required. Incase if you had unprotected intercourse done after the periods then there is risk of pregnancy. Then you need to wait and check for the next period. In case if it is delayed the urine pregnancy test can be done. The pain abdomen, bloating,low backache might be due to constipation. So take adequate fluids and laxatives to prevent constipation.

"i fell while i was rollerblading and landed on my left side on my hip. There is no swelling or anything and i can move it a bit, but i can t put any pressure on it. Like when i try to walk i get this sharp shooting pain in my hip. Any idea of what is wrong?","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, As seen in the history mentioned above you had a fall, so there might be changes in the spinal column. The sharp shooting pain in the Hip what you have mentioned is having connection with the lumbar spine nerve root Entrapment. Using hot water bag in the lower back and doing some simple Core and hip strengthening exercise should help you. In my clinical practice of 12 years have seen people complaining with a lot of sharp shooting pain in the Hip after fall. Most of them respond better to physical therapy and exercise.

"My kid is already in his third year on his pres-school years. But sudden changes happen recently since he always cry and vomit before entering the classroom. But once he is inside the classroom, he can be stabilized in 15 min and be back to its normal attitude. He still shows interest in going to school sicne he is very deligent in doing his homework and also ask for a study on his lesson. Based on the discussion with his teacher, it had started when he finished copying the writings in the board late and the teacher asked them to finish the writing on the board or else, they can t go home. It has been a month since that incident and until now, my kid always vomit and cry when entering the classroom. It come to a point that the teacher made an arrangement that she will be one to fetch the kid in the guardhouse as we are not also allowed to get into the school premise. Pls help how can I help on my kids recent behaviour. Do i need now to go to Pediatric Mental heath professional.","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","DearWelcome to ChatDoctorWe understand your concerns went through your details. The problem can be categorized as behavioral psycho somatic symptom. Naturally your child is not even aware of what is happening to him. Psycho somatic symptoms are such. But, there is nothing to worry. Almost all behavior psycho somatic disorders tend to vanish within some day. In your sons case, there is something which delays the cure. You noted one of the negative approach made by the teacher. I suspect more because that one negative approach is not enough to trigger the present behavior. I suggest you to talk to the teacher again for possible aggressive behavior. Take the name of any psychologist and try to get it. Usually, behavior therapy is the treatment method. Usually we are talking about behavior modification using rewards or punishment. Conditioning is also another option. I suggest you to consult a child psychologist.

I am overweight.","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, as mentioned by you the brief history, what I can understand is that you have swollen ankles and might be painful. After walking for two days in a row there is possibility that you may have got DOES - Delayed onset muscle soreness. Which is common in most people post any excessive physical activity. Also, you mentioned you are obeser than you need to perform physical exercise to lose the excessive accumulation and get the muscle toned. Due to excessive walking there is a soreness in the muscle fibers and are not able to make the Venus return to the optimum. Also, as you have done all of a sudden a good physical exertion there will be fluctuation in the blood pressure and cholesterol. In fact most systems will have fluctuation as it is normal. Chances for any breaking of the blood vessels is uncommon due to walks, but if you want to confirm a Doppler of the lower limbs is recommended to figure out if there are any. For swelling of the ankles you need to first keep the legs elevated and perform ankle toe movements. Also, understanding that physical exercise is recommended highly in you as you are obese. But prior to any exercise regimen a cardiac clearance will be of an advantage.regards Jay In Chat Doctor."

As your details it seems that you are suffering from Congenital hypercoagulable disease. In this case, the blood getting thick day by day and causes clots at any site.

With your description, you are suffering from Chronic pulmonary embolism that also causes right heart chamber enlargement and bilateral leg swelling. But you did not mention regarding breathlessness and leg swelling except chest pain on and off. Definitely this chest pain is due to microclot in pulmonary vessel.

And do your Prothrombin time (PT INR) at regular interval of 15-30 days to keep your INR 2 to 2.5Thank You"

"Hi Doctor, My daughter is one year 2 months. She does not drink milk at all except breast feeding. I am working so can feed at night. She does not go to anybody so it is very difficult to leave her with someone, she keeps crying all the time, grateful if could suggest any medicine for that, waiting for your reply.","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello there, I can see how frustrating that is. Unfortunately there is no medication to help with that. If you are wanting to switch her to cows milk, I would advise you to start feeding her a bottle or hippy cup of the milk. You can still hold her close to your chest for a similar bonding experience. Maybe halfway through, you can pass the bottle to her new babysitter but sit near, so she can see you. Now if you are wanting to continue breastfeeding, you can pump your milk and then do the same as above. Just use the bottle with the breast milk. Its more of a mind game with babies and feeding. Again, there is no medication to assist with the changeover. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to contact us. Good luck!"

I have a pain in my right collarbone when I breathe in. The furthest down it goes is above right breast. Have had squamous cell cancer on base of tongue in 2004 so anything weird in that area is worrisome. My chest may be slightly tight as well or is it anxiety? Idk. These are not the symptoms I had with my cancer. Thank you. YYYY@YYYY,"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. Since you mentioned you had cancer in the past, and I am sure it is treated well. Now as you are facing pain in the collar bone while breathing in and out right above the breast level. So understand this and make more precise the pain region is in between the collar bone and 4th intercostal space. On a safe note it is better to get the heart checked once by a cardiologist and also to take an x-ray of that area, so the superior lobe of the lung will be exposed and will be assessed further. This is just to rule out if you have any systemic pathology. Also coming to the pain, if it is muscular you can do some gradual massage in that area as the spasm of the respiratory muscles can be reduced by the same. Doing regular deep breathing exercises and costal breathing exercises will help improve the capacity of the lungs and also strengthen the muscles of the chest. You can slowly progress to the upper limb exercises which will help to add on some more strength of the pectoralis muscle. Perform some slow static neck exercises as it will also help strengthen the secondary muscles of respiration like the sternocleidomastoid and scale nous group. Since you had a pathology of squamous cell in the past the weakness of the accessory muscles of respiration is a chance. Doing breathing exercise will help improve the strength and reduce the pain. Also to add on, that breathing exercises will even help the cellular physiological to the optimal as the cellular mechanism needs improvement to avoid any further occurrence of the squamous cell.

As you said you had a fall and also some knots over your scalp. You should see if you have any redness of the eye, bleeding from the nose or ear etc. Also, as you have a direct impact on the scalp I will advise to meet a physician on a safer note for him to examine you. Also you can take an MRI to see if any internal bleeding is there at a later stage if you have any abnormal symptoms. Swelling is a normal physiological process, and it subsided in 48-72 hours or may be a little longer depending upon the age and other factors. As you said apart from this you don't have any symptom than you can wait for a while do some icing and things should be fine. If you find any abnormal symptoms you can visit the ER on a safer side.

I am a 15 year old African American teenage girl with a 32-35 bmi. Sometimes when I take a shower I get a dizzy feeling after maybe 6-8 minutes of showering. I also have shortness of breath and my hands shake. I feel absolute miserable while this is happening and today I had to hurry up and finish for fear that I might faint. What is happening to me?,"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello. I have been through your question and understand your concern. Sometimes, while taking a hot bath, especially after a meal, you can have blood sequestration in the skin due to the high temperature of the bath and in the stomach if you are taking the bath after the meal. This causes less blood going in your brain causing the symptoms described. There is nothing to worry about, because it is quite common. Just be sure you take the bath three to four hours after the meal and take the bath at a lower temperature. You will see it will not happen again. Hope this helps, please feel free using MHC for further questions."
"45 year old healthy male with low test, my doctor put me on testim gel for 2.5 years and didn t check my psa levels for 2 years. when he did check it went from 0.34 to 4.1 . He took me off testim and had me tested for 4 consecutive months where my numbers went down from 4.1 to 2.7 to 2.1 to 1.8 to 1.6 where it has stayed. after doing some research I asked him to put me on clomid since he took me off testim cold turkey and I am now suffering all sorts of withdrawal symtoms. I guess my question is do you believe clomid can raise my psa or cause prostate cancer. thank you","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi greetings. What was the reason for low testosterone ? Do you have any other medical problems ? Any issues with testicles or hormones.? I presume that there must have been a reason for low testosterone and hence you were prescribed. NOW, clomifene can increase a pituitary hormone called LH which indirectly can stimulate testis to produce more testosterone if your LH was low previously. There should have been a low response from your pituitary gland and clonidine would have stimulated it. This possibility can be confirmed by testing your testosterone. Hope you are convinced. Regards"

"Hi thereIs it ok to take both a general probiotic (Walgreens brand) and Acidophilius at the same time? I just added the Acidophilus due to recurring minor yeast infection symptoms. I have to take minocycline daily for my rosacea, and have been on that for almost two months.Thank you!","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello and thank you for your question. Yes it is fine to take acidophilus and another probiotic at the same. Acidophilus is just one of the normal gut bacteria that is considered to be a probiotic. Taking multiple forms of probiotic may help relieve your symptoms. Make sure that your general probiotics does not already contain acidophilus because although it will not harm you to take double doses of it, you may be wasting your money if you are taking acidophilus in two different forms.

We went for a check up and my wife has got a follicular study done and the doctor says it is normal and has no problem with her, and the doctor suggested me to take a semen test in november and found the result as only occasional sperms were found.. so they have asked me to take clome tablet 100mg each day for 3 months and take a semen test at the end of the 3rd month,but i have only continued that tablet only one month and not continued till date, so can i go for a semen test now?What are the ways that my wife can get conceived in this method?The gynaecologist says that we can do IUI method of treatment and that too only if my semen test says if its 40 to 60 millions.....One note to say is that i am working in night shift for the past 5 years and my wife was working in day shift, we thought that this may be the problem and so i asked my wife to resign the job, so now she has also resigned the job...Sir can you please give me your contact address so that i can meet you personally for further advice and consultation so that i can have a child very soon.

This week I had two asthma attacks already, and my symptoms are difficulty breathing, extreme numbness/ tingly hands and I felt lightheaded and dizzy. I never had an attack like this years before when I was first diagnosed, before it was like I had asthma but never really had an attack, i just took medications to control and maintain.

Hi During my first pdelivery 3 years back I was diagonised with cholestesis (heavy itching in the 9th month) and hence had an C section..I remember my doc saying then that I need to take care when I take any birth control tablet. I would like to take an ipill today as I do not want to be pregnant..Is it safe for me to take it ? I am 31 years old 5 feet 2 inches and weighing around 65 kgs,"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","HiCholestasis effect is due to the hormone estrogen. That is why your doctor rightly advised against using birth control tablets. When she said this she was talking with reference to birth control pills containing both estrogen and progesterone.The PILL contains progesterone only. So you can use I PILL without worrying about homeostasis. Moreover, the progesterone is washed off from your body in few days. If you wish to postpone pregnancy I advise you to discuss with your doctor and use regular contraception. I hope I have answered to your satisfaction."
my heart beat increases very often and i feel uncomfortable. i feel heaviness in my stomach. i also have a gastric problem i feel. because i feel soffcation in breathing and heart burning as well.  what could be the reason for heart beat increasing. recentlyi had my ECG done and it was normal. is this something which i have to be more cautious about?,"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I understand your concern, and would advise to rule out any possible triggering factors for fast heart beating, like anemia, thyroid gland dysfunction, other organ dysfunctions, etc. I recommend performing a medical check up with a careful physical examination, coupled with some blood tests (complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, chest X-ray study, liver and renal function tests, etc.). If any suspicions for abnormally high heart rate is raised by the above examination, then an ambulatory ECG monitoring would be advisable.  If everything result OK by the above tests, and only normal sinus tachycardia is present, then an investigation towards diagnosis of anxiety should be sought. Hope to have been helpful to you.

"I took my friend to the hospital emergency room about 4 days ago because of abdominal pain.  Her lipase level was 900.  She admits to drinking at least 6 beers every night.  She has also had stomach ulcers in the past.  The Dr in the hospital told her she needed to quit drinking as the high lipase levels were likely a result of excessive drinking.   Yesterday, her primary care Dr took blood tests again and said that all levels are normal but did not specifically mention lipase.  He thinks its her ulcer returning.  How do we tell whether its pancriititis or an ulcer.  She of course thinks its an ulcer.  Im concerned about her drinking.","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi ! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. One fact is sure which you should specifically counsel your friend is to leave alcohol totally, as irrespective of whether it is pancreatitis or a gastric ulcer, alcohol is detrimental and the cause of both these conditions. The pain could have been due to pancreatitis de Nova or the gastric ulcer penetrating the posterior wall of the stomach to make the pancreas inflamed resulting in pancreatitis. In both the cases the serum amylase, and lipase could be increased along with alcoholism. However, high levels like a lipase of 900 points more towards a pancreatitis. If I were your doctor, after her condition is stabilized in the hospital, I would refer her to a gastroenterologist for a possible endoscopic evaluation of her old gastric ulcer. And I would also ask her for an absolute NO to alcohol to prevent further damage to the pancreas which sometimes results in very poor prognosis. She should continue with her treatment advised by the doctors of the hospital. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Chat Doctor."

Will repeat test on friday with orders of no ejaculations Concerned wife,"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, Thanks for writing in. The PSA level is an indicator for possibility of prostate cancer. However, there are additional reasons for having an elevated PSA level, and some men who have prostate cancer do not have elevated PSA. It can be elevated in conditions like infection of the prostate. Repeating the test is necessary for your husband. Most men with an elevated PSA level turn out not to have prostate cancer; only about 25 percent of men who have a prostate biopsy due to an elevated PSA level actually have prostate cancer."

i masturbate nearly one year .but i stopped it now in that time i masturbate with one week intervals and rarely continuosly three days. now i think that my memory was decreased.some nervous problems tooim a studying boy.i want study well.pls help meeee,"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello, Memory problems, nervous problems etc. are never due to masturbation. Masturbation is normal natural and safe. It becomes unhealthy and tiresome only if you masturbate more than three times a week frequently for many weeks. Restrict yourself from doing so and you will be alright. Do not worry too much about it because worry creates anxiety and anxiety could trigger memory problems. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further."
"Last night I experienced extreme pain in my lower abdomen and leg. I had been taking norethisterone for around 2-3 months and started randomly bleeding lightly last Sunday, still bleeding Saturday just past I stopped taking the tablets as not to waste them.  It felt like someone was twisting my insides last night I was sweating and nauseous and could not stop the pain with ibuprofen or heat and the pain just got worse at some point I must have passed out and awoke later drenched in sweat with the pain even more intense abdomen and leg so i got up and I noticed the bleeding had became worse and found a blood clot around the size of piece of liver the pain gradually disappeared but I feel like I have been kicked by a horse from the inside out and I still have some pain in my leg.  Was this a result of the pills?","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, The passage of the large clot may have caused the pain and the associated nausea and sweating. Prolonged use of estrogen or progesterone can result in several side effects including circulation disturbances like thrombosis of limb vessels and embolisms. Please contact your health care provider immediately for assistance. You should get blood counts, bleeding and clotting time along with a trans-vaginal/pelvic sonogram to look for local causes. You should stop taking the Chat Doctor.  Wish you good health."
"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ? Please type your query here... My 4 year old son has been complaining about once a week that his heart hurts he is very active and very healthy, I am not sure if I should have this check out. Please advise. Thanks","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi.... there are 2 issues in here - 1. A 4-year-old cannot say that complaint just like that to seek attention.2. In an active and otherwise well normal 4-year-old kid, it is not a very serious complaint. My suggestions for you - 1. Unless the kid is having breathlessness or fast breathing or abdominal distension or swelling of feet and easy navigability you need not worry.2. No need to panic but get your kid examined by a physician.3. An innocuous simple issue like mitral valve prolapse can cause this sort of symptoms. Regards -"
I have a 8mm stone in my right kidney. Its in the lower pole of my kidney and i have a 5mm in my left kidney in the same place as my right kidney. I had laser surgery in September of 2010 on my left kidney to remove the obstucting stone. My stones are nonobstucting but why do they cause so much pain? I have had reocurring kidney stones since i was 13. Its been 21 years that i have dealt with this on and off. But lately I have been dealing with the pain for two months now. What can i do? How can i manage the pain?,"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi lakhi2013. Thanks for your question. Feeling bad for your situation. MOST OF THE KIDNEY STONE OR URETERIC STONE CAUSES PAIN DUE TO IRRITATION OF NERVE NOT SIMPLY DUE TO OBSTRUCTION. Though your stone is non obstructing, but it causes pain, so you should visit an neurosurgeon and if he opines then you should go for operation to remove the stone and in the meantime you can take some antispasmodics like dicyclomine to reduce the pain and plenty of water if by chance the stone will pass out. But you remember up to 6 mm there is high chance of the stone to pass out but in your cases it is unlikely, so you have to go for operation. Thanks"
"Hi, back in the begining of November I caught what I thought was a cold. After five weeks of nose congestion I started taking Cefdinir. The congestion went away but in the half way through the antibiotics I began to get a dull head pain around my whole head. It keep me up at night. I could put my head on a pillow. After the meds, I went back to my general doctor. He told me I was getting better. But that night the pain was terrible. I called him the next day and told him something was wrong. He ordered a CT scan and found that I had a sinus infection in the frontal sinus and ethmoid (spelling) sinus. Since I am allergic to pennicillin, they put me on Cipro but later switched me to Biaxin. It has been slowly getting better, but I still have a dull ache around my head and nerviouness. It wakes me up a couple hours after I fall asleep. Could the CT scan have missed something or (since Ive never had a sinus infection before) is this part of the sinus infection?","If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor The dullness implies that the sinuses are still congested somewhat. In addition to the antibiotics, you would need to consider a decongestant and antihistamine. A topical and oral decongestant may help. These are available over the counter.Also, a topical steroid nasal spray may help as well. This includes meds such as alone, escort, rhinoceros, Flonase. I hope this helps"
I am looking for a dentists opinion. I am 36 and my bottom wisdom tooth is growing in. I have no pain in my tooth but I keep biting down on my gum where it is growing. Do I have to get my wisdom extracted or can the gum be cut to help my wisdom grow in better.,"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Best possible way to decide on removing your wisdom tooth, Would be to do an x-ray and look at position. If there is any bone obstruction which we normally term it as an impaction, then the dentist decides on extraction or removal. If there is soft tissue covering and persistent irritation and inflammation, then the dentist would approach with simple procedure of removal of the soft tissue covering only called operculectomy."
